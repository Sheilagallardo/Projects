EXERCISE 4

How should the string_compare function be implemented to avoid attacks of this type?

It should be implemented with the same number of cycles for each case. To do that, we can construct an additional loop
that add cycles to the letters that don´t coincide with the corresponding letter from the word given, so that the number
of cycles for both types of letters (the ones that coincide and the ones that don´t) are equal. To increase the number
of cycles we simply add basic or useless operations to our new loop.
